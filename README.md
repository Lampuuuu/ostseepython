# ostseepython

It's here you will find every file, every documentation and every assignment that I will ever provide for you doing this little Python course. 

## What you can expect

The assignments will be in German, and with every assignment there will come a PyTest file you can run to know if your solution has met the assignment's requirements, respectively.

All assignments will be written in **Markdown**, ending in `.md`, just like this README file. You can open it in any editor you like, and all the "big" editors will support this format with really great features. 

Alternatively, you can read the `.md` files right here in your browser.

### A code example

The following snippet shows how code examples will look like in Markdown:

```py
# file: test_first.py

def test_passing():
    assert (1, 2, 3) == tuple(range(1, 4))
    
def test_failing():
    assert (1, 2, 3) == tuple(range(1, 3))

```

## What next?

The most convenient way to make use of this little "project" is to clone it to your local machine and pull the updates regularly using git. You can then work on the copies without ever having to visit this site again.

And now: Sleeves Up!
